  Generate images and video using a Google AI Pro subscription via Google Flow
  (labs.google/flow), driven by browser automation (the google-flow MCP server),
  to avoid paying per-credit services for what Google already covers. Use when the
  user asks to generate an image or video and no specific other service is named.
  Images are effectively free (they do not draw down the monthly Flow credit pool);
  video consumes credits.
allowed-tools: Bash, PowerShell

# Google Flow Generate

Runbook to generate images/video on Google Flow through the `google-flow` MCP server.
Set `FLOW_MCP_DIR` below to wherever you cloned this repo.

## STEP 0 — Ensure the dedicated Chrome is up (always run first)

```
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<FLOW_MCP_DIR>/scripts/ensure-flow-chrome.ps1"
```

- `READY` / `LAUNCHED` → proceed.
- `LAUNCHED`: if labs.google shows the marketing landing instead of the app, the user
  must click **"Sign in to Flow"** once in that Chrome window, then continue.
- `FAILED` → report; do not proceed.

If the `mcp__google-flow__*` tools are absent, the MCP server needs a client restart
(it loads into RAM at startup).

## STEP 1 — Connect

Call `flow_connect`:
- `status: connected` → go on.
- `status: oauth_required` → user signs in to Flow once, then retry.
- `WRONG_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT` → stop; setup mismatch.
- `flow_account_check` → `method:"assumed"` means unverified, not a green light.

## STEP 1.5 — Build a faithful prompt (always, before generating)

Flow's agent and the models render far more faithfully from a rich, structured prompt
than from a bare phrase. Turn the user's request into a complete prompt **without
betraying intent** — enrich, never invent:
- Keep every element the user named; never drop or swap any.
- Add only supporting detail (subject + action + setting + lighting + composition +
  style/medium + mood + quality cues; for video also camera movement + pacing). Do NOT
  add subjects/objects/text the user didn't ask for. Preserve explicit constraints
  ("red mug, no logo") verbatim.
- Match `ratio` to the use (16:9 scene, 9:16 story, 1:1 icon).

The server also wraps the prompt so the agent stays bound to it verbatim.

## STEP 2 — Images (free)

`flow_generate_image` with `auto_confirm:true`. Models: `Nano Banana 2` (default),
`Nano Banana Pro` (best fidelity — prefer for complex prompts), `Imagen 4`. Params:
`prompt`, `ratio`, `project_name`, `campaign`. Result `files[]` = saved paths. (The
`credits_consumed` flag is hardcoded; images are free against the Flow pool.)

### Verify & refine (images — free, so always do it)

After generating, **open the image with vision** and compare it to the request element
by element (subjects present? constraints respected? right composition? nothing
unwanted added?). If it matches → deliver. If not → refine the prompt to emphasize the
failed element and regenerate (up to 3×; images cost nothing). This catches real
misses — e.g. the download picking a UI asset instead of the generated image.

## STEP 3 — Video (⚠️ consumes credits)

`flow_generate_video` with `auto_confirm:true` submits, approves the credit dialog,
waits ~1 min and downloads the mp4.
- Credits: Veo 3.1 Lite ~10, Fast ~20, Quality ~100; Omni Flash ~15-30 of ~1000/month.
- **Valid model/duration combo required** (Veo 3.1 Lite = 8s-only on Pro; Omni Flash
  4-10s) — else the agent asks for clarification and nothing generates.
- Confirm with the user before spending credits if not already authorized.
- `auto_confirm:false` stages without spending.

## Fallback map (error → action)

| Error | Action |
|---|---|
| `oauth_required`, `MANUAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` | STOP, user signs in / solves captcha |
| `WRONG_GOOGLE_ACCOUNT` | STOP, setup problem |
| `BROWSER_NOT_CONNECTED`, `NOT_LOGGED_IN`, `FLOW_PAGE_NOT_FOUND` | rerun STEP 0, then fall back |
| `GENERATION_BUTTON_DISABLED`, `GENERATION_TIMEOUT`, `UNKNOWN_UI_CHANGE` | fall back + `flow_discover_ui` |
| `GOOGLE_LIMIT_REACHED` | credits exhausted → fall back |
| `DOWNLOAD_FAILED` | don't regenerate (credits spent) — retry download |

Image fallback: Flow → Gemini API (`fallback/gemini_image_fallback.py`, needs
`GEMINI_API_KEY`) → any per-credit generator you use. Video fallback: Flow → your
per-credit generator directly.
